# Usage with VSCode and Docker
VSCode ships an extension called [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) which allows you to open a repository inside of a Docker container that has all necessary development tools installed. This isolates your development environment from your host machine. Simply install the extension, then run the _"Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen inside Container"_ command from VSCode's command palette. It will take a while to build the container, however after that it will be cached and can be opened quickly.
